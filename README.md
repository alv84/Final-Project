# Final-Project Overview

    <This is a tutorial on how to build a pc.  There are many things that one should consider when building a pc.  Is it better for me?  Is it cheaper?.  In my opionion the answer to these 2 questions is yes.  It is better for one to build to their own pc rather than buy one that is already built.  It is better for the builder mainly because customization can be endless.  Do you want your pc to look like the Star Destroyer from Star Wars?  Say no more.  With a little ingenuity and time, you can build a PC that looks like one, but also have all the items you want inside it.  
    Now on to price.  Building your PC can get quiet expensive, especially with parts being expensive right now, but in the long run, you will save money as you will not have to pay the extra price due to labor.  You can build a pretty good and powerful rig for around $3000 that will blow any pre-built machine out of the water.  For a compareable pre-built gaming PC, such as Alienware, you will be looking at well over $3000 for the same performance.  Now after that overview, lets begin our journey in what should be done when building your new PC.>
