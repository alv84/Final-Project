Many gamers also love to enhance their rooms ambiance with RGB lights.  Gamers also love have a good sound system, such as good computer speakers, or headset.  A good part also that gamers do not mind spending a good penny on is their monitor or computer screen.  Many people prefer to have monitors that have have high refresh rates.
