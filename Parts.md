# Parts
There are many different parts on a PC that you'll need to consider when buying, and all the ones that are about to be listed are the ones that will need to be purchased in order for the pc to work.  When purchasing, also keep in mind what brand you want if you have a certain brand you want.  Most gamers when they build a pc usually go with these brands for their parts: Intel, AMD, MSI, and ASUS.  Now What parts need to be bought when building your first pc?  Well this list will tell you what parts that need to be bought, as well as a few items that you will need that are not considered parts.  You will need the following:

1.  Case or Chasis - This is where you will house all your parts.  Make sure the case is big enough for the kind of build you want.
2.  Motherboard or Mobo - This is a crucial part to the system.  If this part is cheap, then the whole performance of the pc could be bottlenecked.
3.  CPU - This is the brain of the PC.  This is also a very important part.  Most gamers use a quad core or 8 cores.
4.  HDD,SSD, or M.2 - These are the storage devices for a PC. They stand for hard drive, and solid state drive.  Most people use Western Digital Black drives, or Samsung EVO SSD, or the new NVME M.2 drives  which are essentially a type of SSD.
5.  RAM - These are a type of memory, and these help determine the speed at which your computer will run and and be able to help process things faster.
6.  GPU - This is also very important in a gaming PC.  These allows a user to be able to play games wiith very good graphics and keeps the games running smooth.  Without one of these, it will be almost impossible to play most of todays modern games.
7.  Cooling - The system will need a cooling system.  This can be either a series of fans that blow air through the system and across your components to help keep temperatures low, or a liquid cooling system that is used to cool the GPU and CPU.  Liquid cooling is a much more expensive setup than just buying a fan.  Also note,  you will only need to buy a fan for you CPU as cases and GPUs usually already come equiped with these.
8.  Operating SYstem - This is not a part, but a key component one will need to buy is the Operating System to make the pc run.  Users usually purchase Wihdows 10.  Most people purchase the 64-bit system.
9.  Thermal Paste - This is not a part, but very important.  This is used between the CPU and the heatsink of the cooling device you chose for the CPU.  This helps with the transmission of the heat from the CPU to the cooler so it can keep the temperature of the CPU in safe operating range.
10.  Power Supply - This is what powers your whole pc.  Modular power supplies are the best, as they allow you to only put wires on it that you will need, and not have wires on there that you wont use.

These are all the recommended and required parts for building a pc.  The next section will detail on how to assemble all the parts and how to get the PC operational.
